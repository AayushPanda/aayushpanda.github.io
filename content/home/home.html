    <h1 class="big-text">Hi, I'm Aayush!</h1>
    <p>
I'm a highschool senior. Sometimes I do stuff, sometimes they're cool.
<br><br>
This website is supposed to be a personal blog, identity verification thing and a bunch of other stuff.
<br><br>
I'm still making this thing, so feel free to tell me if stuff is broken!
<br><br>
Here's my resume: <a href="/resume_aayush_panda.pdf">aayushpanda.github.io/resume</a>

        <h3>Murphy's general laws</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Nothing is as easy as it looks.
          </li><li>Everything takes longer than you think.
          </li><li>Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.
          </li><li>If there is a possibility of several things going wrong, the one that will cause the most damage will be the one to go wrong. Corollary: If there is a worse time for something to go wrong, it will happen then.
          </li><li>If anything simply cannot go wrong, it will anyway.
          </li><li>If you perceive that there are four possible ways in which a procedure can go wrong, and circumvent these, then a fifth way, unprepared for, will promptly develop.
          </li><li>Left to themselves, things tend to go from bad to worse.
          </li><li>If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked something.
          </li><li>Nature always sides with the hidden flaw.
          </li><li>Mother nature is a bitch.
          </li><li>It is impossible to make anything foolproof because fools are so ingenious.
          </li><li>Whenever you set out to do something, something else must be done first.
          </li><li>The Light at the end of the tunnel is only the light of an oncoming train.

        <h3>Murphy's Military Laws</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If the enemy is in range, so are you.</li>
            <li>Incoming fire has the right of way.</li>
            <li>Don't look conspicuous, it draws fire.</li>
            <li>There is always a way.</li>
            <li>The easy way is always mined.</li>
            <li>Try to look unimportant, they may be low on ammo.</li>
            <li>Professionals are predictable, it's the amateurs that are dangerous.</li>
            <li>The enemy invariably attacks on two occasions:</li>
            <ul><li>When you're ready for them.</li>
            <li>When you're not ready for them.</li></ul>
            <li>Teamwork is essential, it gives them someone else
            to shoot at.</li>
            <li>If you can't remember, the claymore is pointed at you.</li>
            <li>The enemy diversion you have been ignoring will be the main attack.</li>
            <li>A "sucking chest wound" is natures way of telling you to slow down.</li>
            <li>If your attack is going well, you have walked into an ambush.</li>
            <li>Never draw fire, it irritates everyone around you.</li>
            <li>Anything you do can get you shot, including nothing.</li>
            <li>Make it tough enough for the enemy to get in and you won't be able to get out.</li>
            <li>Never share a foxhole with anyone braver than yourself.</li>
            <li>If you are short of everything but the enemy, you are in a combat zone.</li>
            <li>When you have secured an area, don't forget to tell the enemy.</li>
            <li>Never forget that your weapon is made by the lowest bidder.</li>
            <li>Friendly Fire Isn't.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Murphy's Laws of Enginering</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="list">If it's worth doing, it's got to be done right now.</li>
            <li class="list">If it's not worth doing right now, it's not worth doing.</li>
            <li class="list">If you can't understand it, it is intuitively obvious.</li>
            <li class="list">If an experiment works, something has gone wrong.</li>
            <li class="list">If a straight line fit is required, obtain only two data points.</li>
            <li class="list">The more innocuous the modification appears to be, the further its influence will extend.</li>
            <li class="list">If several things that could have gone wrong have not gone wrong, it would have been ultimately beneficial for them to have gone wrong.</li>
            <li class="list">The manufacturer's stated performance figures are the maximum possible, under ideal conditions, when all other variables are controlled, and when the equipment is brand-new.</li>
            <li class="list">The complexity of a tool is inversely proportional to the skill of the user.</li>
            <li class="list">If you must choose between two computer programs, the one that will be the most useful to you will be the one that doesn't work.</li>
            <li class="list">Corollary: The one that works will be obsolete.</li>
            <li class="list">The first place to look for information is in the section of the manual where you least expect to find it.</li>
